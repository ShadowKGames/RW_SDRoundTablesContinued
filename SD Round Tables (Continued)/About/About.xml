	tired of living on the edge? want things to go round? this will (most definitly not) be the solution^^
	
	adds three round tables to the game in different sizes (1x1,2x2,3x3). dont need research to be build.
	
	stats from the middle and big one are same as the vanilla tables (short/long). small round table has slightly reduced stats compared to the short vanilla tables.
